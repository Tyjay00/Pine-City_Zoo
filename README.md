# 🐾 Pine City Zoo Website | IT Varsity & FNB App Academy

Welcome to the **Pine City Zoo** web project! This is a simple, responsive HTML/CSS-based website that provides information about zoo animals, attractions, a map, and weather updates.

## 🛠️ Features

- Responsive layout using basic HTML and CSS
- Tab-style top and bottom navigation for ease of use
- Visual elements like logos and a map to enhance engagement

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Make sure all files, including images and CSS, are in their correct folders.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to explore the site.

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure to add all the supporting `.html` files and images (`logo.png`, `map.png`) for full functionality.

- Currently, the "MAP" tab is not a separate page—it displays a map image directly on the homepage.
