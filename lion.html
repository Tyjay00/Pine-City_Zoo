                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts.The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard "spine" or "spur" composed of dermal papillae. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth, develops at around 5+1‚ÅÑ2 months of age and is readily identifiable at the age of seven months.</p>
                <p>Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.</p>
                <p>The skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.The lion has a high concentration of fast twitch muscle fibres, giving them quick bursts of speed but less stamina.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the Lion at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
