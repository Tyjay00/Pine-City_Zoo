                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. The rest of the animal's coat is white.The bear's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade.Studies in the wild have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration, while up close, they rely more on blending in.The black ears may be used to display aggression, while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another.The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.</p>
                <p>The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A study revealed that a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda had a bite force of 1298.9 Newton (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 Newton (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb). Females are generally 10–20% smaller than males. They weigh between 70 kg (150 lb) and 125 kg (276 lb).The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).</p>
                <p>The giant panda's paw has a digit similar to a thumb and five fingers; the thumb-like digit – actually a modified sesamoid bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating.The giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in), is the second-longest in the bear family, behind the sloth bear.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the Pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
