                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb).</p>
                <p>The koala is a robust animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail.[10]: 1 [30] It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb),[30] making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.[31] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland.[22]: 7  The species is sexually dimorphic: males are 50% larger than females. Males' noses are more curved[31] and sport chest glands, which are visible as bald patches.[22]: 55  The female's pouch opening is secured by a sphincter which holds the young in</p>
                <p>Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on them. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Like other marsupials, koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they live for their first six to seven months. They are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the Koala at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
